Guarantees for the enjoyment of digital rights remain absent in Venezuela. On one hand, disinvestment, and on the other, the discretionary use of political power, prevent the full development of citizens’ digital competencies and have widened the gap between those who have access to the internet and those who do not.

In Venezuela, access to information is crucial due to the country’s complex social dynamics. With censorship dominating traditional media and the global rise of the internet, network access has become essential for the exercise of civil and political rights. However, website blocking is used as a tool of censorship.

More than a hundred URLs are blocked in Venezuela, including independent news websites. This restricts both freedom of expression and access to information. During 2022 and 2023, existing blocks were maintained and new ones were implemented.

These arbitrary actions not only violate citizens’ right to information in Venezuela, but also hinder education, research, freedom of association, and the development of work-related activities, among many other rights.

Internet connectivity in the country can be described as intermittent. Outages and disruptions occur regularly, leaving large areas without access.
